Please keep in mind that, to the extent a third-party service provider needs to access your information in order to perform services for us, we share your information with that provider.

Unless expressly otherwise stated by WunderBytes, WunderBytes is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of linked third-party sites or applications. When you leave the WunderBytes Services and go to a third-party site or application, our Privacy Policy will no longer apply, and any information collected from or about you on the third-party site or application will be governed by the privacy policy of that third party. Third-party sites’ or applications’ privacy policies and data practices may be substantially different from those of WunderBytes. They may send their own cookies, web beacons, etc. to your computer or mobile device and may collect data about you and make use of the data in ways that we would not.

To receive notifications on updates or changes to the WunderBytes Services, we ask that you keep your account updated with most relevant personal information (i.e. your current email address). In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

All notification emails and WunderBytes newsletters include instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future. Additionally you may send us a message using our “Contact Us” page. Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. Please be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.

                        <p>WunderBytes aims to provide you with a secure customer experience. WunderBytes user accounts are secured by user-created passwords and, in some cases, third-party sign-on services (e.g., Firebase). WunderBytes takes precautions to ensure that user account information is kept private. We use commercially reasonable measures to protect user information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to user information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. However, we do not guarantee that these efforts will completely protect user account information. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to WunderBytes and you do so at your own risk. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. We will endeavor to notify users in the event that the security of their personal information is breached or compromised. By submitting personal information through any of the WunderBytes Services, you expressly consent to receiving our notification regarding any breach or compromise, or suspected breach or compromise, of the security of your personal information, by email or postal mail, as we deem appropriate and as required by law. For any additional information about the security measures we use on WunderBytes, please contact us at wunderxmas@wunderbytes.eu.
                        </p>
                        <p>We urge you to keep your username, password, and other account access information in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account when you have finished using the WunderBytes Services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an internet cafe.</p>
